# SilentSnap
SilentSnap is a Chrome extension designed for Snapchat Web that allows you to save received photos without alerting the sender. Unlike the mobile app, where a notification message appears in the chat when you download a photo, SilentSnap works discreetly to avoid any visible notifications.
