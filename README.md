# SilentSnap
SilentSnap is a Chrome extension designed for Snapchat Web that allows you to save received photos and videos without alerting the sender. Unlike the mobile app, where a notification message appears in the chat when you download a photo or a video, SilentSnap works discreetly to avoid any visible notifications.

- Save photos or videos, even without saving them in the chat.
- An intuitive interface for quick onboarding.
